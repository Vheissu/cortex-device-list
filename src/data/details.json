        "description": "The Bogner Shiva Guitar Amp Head 20th Anniversary comes with a pair of KT88's and the amp is rated at 90 watts. The clean channel has an entire new boost circuit. Unlike the tone stack bypass boost on the other Shiva model this boost has a separate gain stage which brings this channel into Plexi territory when boost is engaged. The tone controls stay in the circuit and affect the sound.",

        "description": "Released in January 1990, the JCM900 boasted higher gain and lower noise coupled with the classic Marshall tone. The series was originally comprised of the single channel Hi-Gain Master Volume MK III and the two channel Hi-Gain Dual Reverb. Both amps contained a series FX loop, two line outputs and a high/low switch that could be used to drop the power from 100w to 50w. This all-valve amp is famous for its tone and roadworthiness while maintaining the original high gain and dual reverb functions. Channel A starts out clean and builds to a crunch while channel B drives the higher gain tones from smooth distortion to a searing scream. The JCM900 4100 is equipped with a series FX loop with its own level control for use with FX or stomp boxes.",
