Unlike the tone stack bypass boost on the other Shiva model this boost has a separate gain stage which brings this channel into Plexi territory when boost is engaged. The tone controls stay in the circuit and affect the sound.",

The series was originally comprised of the single channel Hi-Gain Master Volume MK III and the two channel Hi-Gain Dual Reverb. Both amps contained a series FX loop, two line outputs and a high/low switch that could be used to drop the power from 100w to 50w. This all-valve amp is famous for its tone and roadworthiness while maintaining the original high gain and dual reverb functions. Channel A starts out clean and builds to a crunch while channel B drives the higher gain tones from smooth distortion to a searing scream. The JCM900 4100 is equipped with a series FX loop with its own level control for use with FX or stomp boxes.",

Finnegan, working with MIT graduate Fred Fenning, spent over four and a half years developing the circuit to create an overdrive that would emulate the distortion of a tube amplifier at high volume without altering the underlying tone. The Centaur is credited with popularizing 'transparent' overdrives and features a unique dual-ganged gain pot that blends clean and overdriven signals. At low gain it acts as a boost, while higher settings deliver pure distortion. Only around 8,000 units were produced, and the pedal has become highly sought after, with prices reaching $20,000 by 2024.",

The name 'Tube Screamer' came when Sammy Ash of Sam Ash Music remarked that the pedal sounded like a 'screaming tube amp.' The TS808 is renowned for its dynamic, touch-sensitive distortion and throaty midrange boost that helps guitars cut through a mix. Its legendary JRC4558D overdrive circuitry, with two diodes in the op-amp feedback loop, was groundbreaking at the time. Stevie Ray Vaughan famously used the TS808 to achieve his trademark juicy strat tone, and it remains one of the most copied and modified overdrive pedals ever made.",

Its unique combination of MOSFET transistors and voltage-controlled clipping delivers remarkably tube-like tones with extraordinary touch sensitivity and dynamic response. The pedal features an HP/LP switch that toggles between British-style tones (High Peak) with an upper-midrange push, and more transparent American-flavored tones (Low Peak). The OCD can run at 18 volts for increased headroom, and includes an internal switch for true bypass or enhanced buffer modes. It has become known for its transparency, power, and versatility across a wide range of gain settings.",

Named after the rat-infested basement where it was designed, only twelve 'Bud Box' prototypes were initially produced before mass production began in 1979. The RAT's distinctive sound comes from its LM308 op-amp gain stage with hard-clipping diodes. The unique Filter control is a low-pass filter that can sweep almost the entire audio spectrum from 475Hz to 32KHz. The RAT has spawned numerous variants including the RAT2, Turbo RAT (with LED clipping), and You Dirty RAT (with germanium diodes), and its simple yet effective circuit has made it one of the most enduring distortion pedals in rock history.",

First released in 1969 as a collaboration between Mike Matthews and Bob Myer, the original 'Triangle Big Muff' became the first overwhelming success for Electro-Harmonix. Unlike earlier fuzz pedals that used germanium transistors, the Big Muff employs silicon transistors in a four-stage circuit: a clean boost driving two clipping stages, followed by a tone recovery stage. This design delivers massive sustain with harmonic distortion and a distinctive thick, creamy fuzz tone. David Gilmour famously used it on Pink Floyd's Animals and The Wall, and it became integral to the sound of Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr., and countless alternative rock bands through the 1980s and 1990s.",

Produced between 1966 and 1981, it was developed after Pete Townshend of The Who asked Jim Marshall to build him a more powerful amp. The result was a 100-watt beast that, paired with two 4x12 speaker cabinets, created the legendary 'Marshall stack'. The Super Lead features two channels with four inputs (often jumpered together for a thicker tone) and no master volume - it needed to be played loud to sound its best. The celebrated Plexi-era amps made between 1967 and 1969 are considered the most revered, and their aggressive, midrange-heavy sound helped establish Marshall's signature 'crunch' tone.",

Named for Jim and Terry Marshall (JTM) and rated at 45 watts (45), it was developed after London guitarists requested an alternative to imported American Fender amplifiers. While based on the Fender Bassman circuit, the JTM45 featured an all-aluminum chassis, Celestion speakers in a closed cabinet, and modified feedback circuitry that gave it a distinctive British snarl. Early versions used 5881 power tubes, later replaced by KT66s. The amp was first publicly tested at the Ealing Club in September 1963 and went on to be used by David Gilmour, The Rolling Stones, and Jimi Hendrix. The 2x12 combo version was famously used by Eric Clapton on the legendary 'Beano' album with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.",

Produced for only a single year, these amps quickly became rare collector's pieces fetching premium prices. Based on the JCM800 2203 and 2204 models, the Silver Jubilee added more gain via diode clipping and a half-power mode to achieve great tones at lower volumes. The distinctive silver covering and chrome panel made it visually iconic, while its tone caught the attention of guitarists like Slash, who used it extensively. In 2015, Marshall reissued the amp as the 2555X with improvements including better speaker output options and fixed switching circuitry.",

The amp features selectable tube or silicon diode rectification - tube rectification provides a 'spongier' feel with more elastic string response, while silicon diodes offer tighter attack and more headroom. This dual rectification system gave the amp its name. The original two-channel design featured Orange (Clean/Vintage modes) and Red (Modern mode) channels, delivering a scooped midrange, ominous low end, and ripping harmonic-laden top end. In 2025, Mesa/Boogie released the 90s Dual Rectifier reissue based on the original specs.",

        "description": "The Fender Deluxe Reverb was introduced in 1963 by incorporating an onboard spring reverb tank to the newly redesigned Fender Deluxe amplifier. The Blackface models (1963-1967) featuring the AB763 circuit are considered the pinnacle of Fender circuit design. This 22-watt tube amplifier is powered by a pair of 6V6GT power tubes with a GZ34 rectifier, delivering the typical blackface 60's sparkle with a scooped clean sound but with more smooth breakup, sag and compression than its bigger siblings. It has found its way into more recording studios, clubs and bars than any other Fender amp, making it one of the most popular amps among all Fender models for decades.",

        "description": "The Fender Princeton Reverb is a compact, tube-driven combo guitar amplifier introduced in 1964 as part of Fender's Blackface era lineup. Designed by Leo Fender during the company's pre-CBS ownership, it evolved from the original 1946 Princeton student model. The Princeton Reverb is the smallest blackface/silverface Fender amp with both tremolo and reverb. With a 10-inch speaker run by a 12-15W dual 6V6 amp, it delivers a true 'American' Fender tone with punchy, responsive lows together with chimey highs. The Black Panel Princeton Reverb is one of the crown jewels of mid-60s combo amps and has been among the most widely used recording amps since its introduction.",

It revolutionized the industry with its 4-channel design and individual inserts. The four channels - Clean, Crunch, Mega and Lead - each have dedicated gain, EQ and master volume controls. The Clean channel produces Diezel's signature sparkling chime, while the high-gain Mega and Lead channels deliver the tight precision distortion that made guitarists like Adam Jones (Tool), Neal Schon (Journey), and James Hetfield (Metallica) early adopters. Each power tube has a fault indicator and separate fuse for reliability.",

The three channels (Clean, Crunch and Lead) deliver signature melodic overtones with increased saturation, gain and improved low-mid frequency definition. The 100W head features eight 12AX7 preamp tubes and four 6L6 matched power tubes that generate wide open, sparkling articulate highs with a controlled bass response heard in Eddie's unmistakable rhythm playing. The 5150III 100S Head is identical to the setup Eddie Van Halen most recently toured with, featuring his exact custom modifications including an adjustable bias port.",

It has been the undisputed go-to guitar amp for scores of rock, hardcore, and metal bands since 1992. The 6505 is essentially the renamed 5150 after the EVH trademark change. Known for its raw tone, relentless power, and road-proven reliability, the 6505 delivers 120 watts from five 12AX7 preamp tubes and four 6L6GC power tubes. Famed metal producers and engineers like Andy Sneap and Colin Richardson often discuss how the amp sits perfectly in a mix, with Guitar Player Magazine noting its use on Machine Head's Burn My Eyes 'defined a generation of guitar tone.'",

        "description": "The Soldano SLO-100 (Super Lead Overdrive 100) was designed by Mike Soldano and released in 1987 as the first production model from Soldano Custom Amplification. Hand-built and pushing the boundaries of high-gain guitar tone, it was an immediate success at the 1987 NAMM Show. Its thick, high-gain tones attracted lead guitarists like Joe Satriani, Warren DeMartini, George Lynch, and Mick Mars. Eddie Van Halen used an SLO during the early 1990s and later based his own Peavey 5150 on it. The amp features a cascading-gain preamp structure with five 12AX7 tubes, while four 6L6GC power tubes provide 100 watts with tight low-end. A key part of its success is that overdriven tones are created entirely in the preamp section, so it doesn't require ear-splitting volume levels to sound its best.",
